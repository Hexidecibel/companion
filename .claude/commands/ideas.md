# Ideas

Introspect the codebase and suggest ideas for features, refactors, or general improvements.

## Instructions

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` to understand the project structure and architecture

2. Read `FEATURES.md` to understand what's already been built

3. Read `todo.md` to see what's already planned (avoid duplicating these)

4. Read `plan.md` to see what's in progress

5. Explore the codebase — scan key files, look at recent git history, check for:
   - Code patterns that could be improved
   - Missing features that would complement existing ones
   - UX rough edges or inconsistencies
   - Performance opportunities
   - Architecture improvements
   - Developer experience improvements

6. Present 5-10 ideas organized by category:

   ### Features
   - Ideas for new user-facing functionality

   ### Refactors
   - Code quality, architecture, or pattern improvements

   ### Polish
   - UX improvements, edge cases, visual refinements

   ### Infrastructure
   - Build, deploy, testing, or tooling improvements

7. For each idea:
   - One-line description
   - Brief rationale (why it matters)
   - Rough scope estimate (small / medium / large)

## Rules

- Don't suggest things already in todo.md or plan.md
- Don't suggest things already in FEATURES.md (already shipped)
- Focus on practical, high-impact ideas
- Prioritize ideas that build on existing strengths
- Be specific — "improve performance" is too vague, "lazy-load highlight.js languages" is good
