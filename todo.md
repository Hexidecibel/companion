# Todo

Quick capture for ideas and tasks. Run `/plan` to process into detailed plans.

---

## Upcoming
- Split snap layouts -- show snap zone boxes (like Windows/macOS) when dragging/splitting sessions into different configurations
- Mobile footer overflow -- 7 buttons is too many for one row. Consider two rows, moving some to header (currently unused), or a collapsible overflow menu
- Tool card visibility toggle -- add button to show/hide tool call cards in conversation view to reduce clutter in long conversations

## Deferred
- iOS push notifications -- implement native APNs plugin for tauri-plugin-fcm (currently no-op on iOS, Android only)
- OpenAI Codex CLI parser -- roadmap item, not prioritized
