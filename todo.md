# Todo

Quick capture for ideas and tasks. Run `/plan` to process into detailed plans.

---

## Upcoming
- Unify terminal and chat input: keep InputBar visible when terminal is shown, send Up/Down/Enter as tmux keys when in terminal mode. Remove pause/refresh buttons from terminal toolbar. Just a simple toggle between chat mode and terminal mode sharing the same input bar.
- Desktop dashboard mode -- toggleable card-based dashboard view alongside current sidebar (for monitoring)

## In Progress
(none)

## Done
- [done] Mac desktop app: file path links should open in file viewer
- [done] Parse task-notification XML messages properly and show a tool result card

## Deferred
- OpenAI Codex CLI parser -- roadmap item, not prioritized
- macOS desktop polish -- global hotkey, deep links, code signing, auto-update
- Windows release -- Tauri cross-compiles, need CI/CD pipeline
- Make parallel worker agent spawning optional (sometimes might not make sense)
