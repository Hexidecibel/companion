# Todo

Quick capture for ideas and tasks. Run `/plan` to process into detailed plans.

---

## Upcoming
- File viewer still freezes on open
- Mac desktop app: file path links should open in file viewer (tappable paths don't work in Tauri WebView)
- Parse task-notification XML messages properly and show a tool result card (with link to output file)
- [done] Web/mobile parity -- mobile search, mobile plan viewer (plan.md #13)
- [planned] Unified Tauri mobile -- replace React Native with Tauri 2.0 Android/iOS (plan.md #19)

## In Progress
(none)

## Deferred
- OpenAI Codex CLI parser (plan.md #10) -- roadmap item, not prioritized
- macOS desktop nice-to-have -- global hotkey, deep links, code signing, auto-update (plan.md #18)
- Windows and Linux releases -- Tauri already cross-compiles, need CI/CD pipeline for all platforms
- Make parallel worker agent spawning optional (sometimes might not make sense)
