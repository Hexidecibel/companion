# Todo

Quick capture for ideas and tasks. Run `/plan` to process into detailed plans.

---

## Upcoming
- Desktop dashboard mode -- toggleable card-based dashboard view alongside current sidebar (for monitoring)
- iOS push notifications -- implement native APNs plugin for tauri-plugin-fcm (currently no-op on iOS, Android only)

## In Progress
- Unify terminal and chat input

## Done
- [done] Replace archive/history with cross-session conversation search
- [done] Mac desktop app: file path links should open in file viewer
- [done] Parse task-notification XML messages properly and show a tool result card

## Deferred
- OpenAI Codex CLI parser -- roadmap item, not prioritized
- macOS desktop polish -- global hotkey, deep links, code signing, auto-update
- Windows release -- Tauri cross-compiles, need CI/CD pipeline
- Make parallel worker agent spawning optional (sometimes might not make sense)
