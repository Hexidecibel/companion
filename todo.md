Quick capture for ideas and tasks. Run `/plan` to process into detailed plans.

## Upcoming
- iOS push notifications -- implement native APNs plugin for tauri-plugin-fcm (currently no-op on iOS, Android only)
- Mobile app icons -- logos not displaying correctly on Android (Tauri vector override) and iOS; need proper icon pipeline for both platforms
- Top-level skills should all work and be friendly for new users

## Deferred
- OpenAI Codex CLI parser -- roadmap item, not prioritized
- macOS desktop polish -- global hotkey, deep links, code signing, auto-update
- Windows release -- Tauri cross-compiles, need CI/CD pipeline
