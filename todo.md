## UI Fixes
- [planned] Settings page: about area at bottom needs padding, spilling over into safe area

## Features
- [planned] Permissions bypass toggle - per-server setting to match Claude's auto-approve mode
- [planned] Server connection on/off toggle on dashboard - quick enable/disable per server
- [planned] Conversation archive & search - save compacted convos, full-text search (MVP: no search yet)

## Daemon
- [skipped] CLI for daemon management - current /up /down skills work fine
