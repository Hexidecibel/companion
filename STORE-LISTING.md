## Full Description

```
Companion is a mobile and desktop app for monitoring your AI coding CLI sessions in real time. Run the lightweight daemon on your server, and interact with your coding sessions from anywhere.

REAL-TIME SESSION MONITORING
Watch your AI coding sessions live with full conversation rendering — markdown, code blocks, diffs, and tool call details. See at a glance which sessions are working, waiting for input, or idle.

RESPOND FROM ANYWHERE
Send text, images, and quick replies directly from your phone. Answer questions, approve tool calls, and review plans without switching to your terminal.

INTERACTIVE TERMINAL
Access your tmux terminal directly from the app with full ANSI color rendering. Send keystrokes, navigate with arrow keys, and manage sessions on the go.

FILE VIEWER
Open any file referenced in conversation with syntax highlighting for 22 languages, markdown rendering, diff views, and a fuzzy file finder.

PUSH NOTIFICATIONS
Get notified when your AI needs input. 2-tier escalation sends a browser notification immediately and a push notification after a configurable delay. Quiet hours and per-session mute keep things manageable.

PARALLEL WORK GROUPS
Spawn multiple coding sessions in parallel, each in its own git worktree. Monitor progress, answer questions inline, and merge completed branches — all from the app.

MULTI-SERVER SUPPORT
Connect to multiple servers simultaneously. Dashboard shows all sessions across all servers with connection status and activity indicators.

CODE REVIEW
Review all file changes from a session in a consolidated diff view. Approve or request changes without leaving the app.

SELF-HOSTED & PRIVATE
Your data stays on your server. No accounts, no telemetry, no third-party analytics. Open source under MIT license.

Companion supports Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows, and web browsers — all from a single codebase.
